      <h2>Remote Sensing Applications Centre</h2>
      <p>
        Uttar Pradesh was the first and foremost state in the country to establish the first state Remote Sensing Applications Centre, Uttar Pradesh, in Lucknow. RSAC-UP has been utilizing the geospatial technologies of satellite remote sensing, Image Processing, GIS, GPS, LiDAR, etc. Development using AI, ML, DL & AL methods in conjunction with geophysical surveys, soil and water testing techniques for assessment and management of various natural resources of the state with a view to achieve sustainable development.

      <p>
        With the passage of time, the domain from natural resource management to infrastructure mapping and monitoring, utility mapping, disaster management, RSAC-UP is involved in training, capacity building and vocational educational programme on geospatial technologies such as running M. Tech in Remote Sensing. RSAC-UP is carrying out the work in crop area and production estimation of different crops, Space Based Information Support for Decentralized Planning, Wasteland Assessment, Monitoring of Integrated watershed, Monitoring Vulnerability Assessment, desertification and Land Degradation, Assessment of wetland areas, Water Sector Restructuring, Unauthorized Colony Mapping with the area of Development Authorities of U.P., Asset Mapping, Urban planning including smart city and infrastructure planning.

        Further, the Centre is also working on pilot basis for the projects such as precision farming, soil crop, selection of cold storages for crop management, rejuvenation of alluvial rivers, disaster management, pilot studies on site suitability for harvesting, fruit belt development, fodder crops and solid waste disposal etc. The Centre is also working on GIS mapping for schools, hospital and satellite data and GIS based geoportal. Further, the Centre is imparting training on remote sensing applications to the officials of various departments, faculty members and research scholars of Universities. M.Tech in Remote Sensing and GIS in affiliation with AKTU is also being run here.
